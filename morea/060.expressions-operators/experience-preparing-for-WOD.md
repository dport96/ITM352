# E3: Preparing for WODs Technical Essay

By the date and time indicated on the Schedule page, 
write a technical essay (blog entry) that summarizes your experiences 
reflecting on your experience in preparing for and your resulting performance on the last WOD. This is the WOD you should discuss in this essay.

** NOTE ** Do this blog AFTER you have done the last WOD on the schedule due before this assignment. 

Do not include the source code in your essay. Instead, address the following:

 1. Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to the WOD page for further details
 
 2. Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.
 
 3. Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WODs before this?
 
 4. Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.

Use the same blog as you did in E1. When you complete your blog entry submit the 
link to Laulima as you did in E1.
