This assessment evaluated the ability of students to write a high quality technical essay summarizing their experiences and insights in preparing for WODs.

Discussion:

* Most of the essays were very honest and insightful. I've heard some comments that it was helpful to know that others have been struggling with the same problems. It's very common to feel like you are the only one having trouble and are behind in the class.   
* Oddly, quite a few people did not submit this essay. Why not? 
* People generally seem to be feeling much more confident in their ability to complete a WOD even if they have not done so yet. Progress is being made and many people said they were very close to completing the WOD but got hung up on something. However people seemed to know how to improve themselves for the next WOD. 
* Several people noted that they tend to over-think the WOD tasks making them harder than they actually are. The advice is to always start simple and build up complexity if needed. 
* The most common issue seems to be not understanding the instructions and requirements. In software development instructions and requirements will often be unclear or incomplete. Rather than waste time trying to figure out it or fill in the gaps with your own stuff it's better to start asking questions!
* Another common issue seems to be not fully understanding the WOD. Many people reported that they relied too much on the screencast to get the WOD rather than understanding the code and how to apply the concepts. That is, looking at the particular solution given in the screencast rather than thinking about how that solution came about. 
* Some people reported that they did not sufficiently pay attention to the readings and class labs assuming that the WOD would not use anything different then in the WOD. The WODs will apply the same *concepts* but will usually make use of slight different details. For example, a lot of people got hung up on getting the decimal part of a float value because they did not pay attention to the casting operators such as (int) discussed in the readings anmd in class but was not used in the WOD. 
* Another common issue seems to be about remembering to do things efficiently so you will not DNF e.g. copying an example HTML table from the page source rather than write from scratch which takes a lot of time. In this case, many people saw this in the screencast but did not try it themselves or forgot that they could do this for the Invoice3 WOD. The lesson here is to avoid trying to memorize a solution from the screencast. This will rarely be helpful. What you want to pick up is the approach to working efficiently (such as looking for tools that can help you with tedious error prone tasks such as creating HTML tables).
* Good to see that many people are repeating the WODs trying to get under DNF and this seems to really work. Many of the new WOD completer's mentioned this as their key to success. They also mentioned that they didn't just memorize the screencast solution. Rather, they tried to fully understand the solution then re-did the WOD using this understanding.  
* Many people felt that the little mistakes they made along they way slow them down in the end. The advice for this is to never write more than 7 lines of code before checking that your code works and is what you want. ADVICE: try writing comments FIRST then add code related to that comment. This is very helping in slowing things down and keeping you focused on specific tasks. You don't get "lost" in what to do and helps you outline the tasks needed. It also helps you more quickly know where to look when somethig doesn't work!
* When writing about your WOD experiences do not talk about how hard or easy the WOD is. This will vary quite a bit from WOD to WOD and each person will find a different set of things hard/easy. Focus on how the way you prepare works or does not work well!
