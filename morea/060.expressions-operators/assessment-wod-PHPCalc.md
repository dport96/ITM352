  JAVASCRIPTCalc was similar to the Invoice1 WOD.

  Here is an [example JAVASCRIPTCalc solution]({{ site.baseurl }}/morea/060.expressions-operators/JAVASCRIPTCalc_alt.zip) based on the hints given
  

  Discussion:

     * If you are a new non-DNF'er, why not share with others what helped you succeed. Write about it in your E3 blog entry.  
     * A few non-DNF'ers stated in class that they actually practised Invoice1 until they got under DNF. This seems to help! 
     * A lot of people very nearly completed. Try to look at what's slowing you down. Do you prepare a new project **before** the WOD starts? Are you taking advantage of already written code? Do you plan out what you will do before starting to write code?  
     * Many people asked for help during this WOD. Most of the problems were about getting the decimal part of the last calculation. Apparently the casting operators like `(int)` from last week were not well understood. Perhaps the WOD or lab should have had you work with this?
     * Remember, don't write too much code before testing. Errors build up with each line of code you write and it's slower to try to find multiple errors in a lot of code rather than one error in a small amount of code.
     * Some people got hung up on creating the table. I noticed a lot of people didn't worry about the table at first. They just output all the results in plain text. Then they copies the HTML from the table in the example output and replace the cells with the expressions. This is a good way to go! 
     * Generally people felt they could do this WOD if they were not under time pressure. I believe this, but remember that the point of a timed WOD is to **increase your skill and confidence in programming efficiently**. The time pressure is essential in this. You want to be so well prepared that the time pressure doesn't matter to your ability to complete a WOD.
     * Quite a few people have not gotten the hang of `printf()`. This is such a useful function that you must go back and try to understand how to use it now.
