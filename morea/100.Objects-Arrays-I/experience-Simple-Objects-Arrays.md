# Simple Objects and Arrays
This lecture will introduce you using objects for unordered collections and arrays for ordered collections.

# Watch the screencast before class!
Open the [presentation slides](ITM352_Objects_Arrays.ppt). 

Open the [screencast](https://youtu.be/XLu-vpcDE8c) and follow along with the lecture. Be sure to try all the examples you see in the lecture  **don't just sit and watch the show!**

Jot down notes with problems or questions (you can use the editor maybe make code comments, Word, Notepad, etc.). Bring these to class.

In class we will see more examples, answer questions, and do the lab exercises.
