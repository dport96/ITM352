  SmartPhoneProducts3 is a minor variant of the SmartPhoneProducts2 WOD replacing the variable-variables with arrays.

  Discussion:

     * 94% not DNF'ing! 88% had better than Sd!!! If this was your first non-DNF congratulations! But be sure to reflect a bit about what worked this time so you can do even better next time! If you did well, think about what got you there. Can you do even better? If you DNF'ed you will need to make an appointment with to see if we can figure out what is holding up your progress.
     * It's clear by the large number of Rx's that many people are still improving their WOD performance.
     *  You may think that this was just an easy WOD. Not at all! Remember that programming skill level curve? It's slow at first then suddenly increases. After working hard at this, suddenly you can do things you had a tough time with previously.
     * I suggest that it's more that your skills have increased and you know how to prepare effectively for a WOD. Consider what you needed to do: (1) understand the requirements and identify where changes needed to be made, (2)determine how to convert var-vars into arrays,(3) understand clearly how loops work with arrays, (4) remove code no longer used. (5) find and fix bugs, (6) use VS Code effectively. Do you think you could have completed this WOD at the start of class even if you understood loops and arrays? Now... on to the next challenging skill level!
     *  A few people seemed a little confused about the need to delete code that's no longer used. For example leaving all the var-var identifier variables.
     *  If you used $num_products=5 or hard coded the end value for the loop then think about why it would be better to use count() or sizeof() to end the loop. Always code things a little but more general than you need.
     *  Many people are not taking advantage of find and replace. Too slow, too error prone to do everything manually! Learn it! Use it! Benef-it!
