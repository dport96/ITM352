  SmartPhoneProducts4 is a variant of the Invoice5 WOD replacing the parallel arrays with a multi-dimensional array.

  Discussion:

     * Another good performance! 97% completion rate!
     * Congratulations to all those who are now succeeding with WODs! 
     * It's clear by the large number of Rx's that many people are still improving their WOD performance.
     * Unfortunately there were are number of Sd "close calls" from people who had been completing the WODs just fine previously. This may be from poor preparation due to the short time between this WOD and the last WOD. If you had a hard time with this WOD but not on the previous one it is suggested that you look carefully at what you did differently to prepare. In particular many of the people who had trouble said they did not do the WOD until they got under DNF time. 
     * Some people still believe that the WOD's are getting easier and that it's not their skill that is improving. I've head comments like "The only reason I completed this WOD was because Arrays are easy" It's difficult to get perspective when you're on a fast moving train! Here's another perspective - perhaps Arrays are easy because your skills and understanding have developed to the point where you quickly understand and appreciate the elegance of using arrays. Ask yourself this, would you have been able to so quickly understand and apply Arrays at the start of this class? What if you had to do SmartphoneProducts4 in the first week of class? You might try even going back to an early WOD and see if you can do it in under DNF time. For example, [JAVASCRIPTCalc](../morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-JAVASCRIPTCalc.html) (over 90% DNF).
