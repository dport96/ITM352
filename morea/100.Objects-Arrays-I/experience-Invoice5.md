# Use a loop and arrays to generate an invoice

1. Start by copying the [Invoice4](../100.Arrays-I/experience-Invoice4.html) into a new JAVASCRIPT project. Check that the table displays properly. Fix any problems present.

2. Then use the information in the three arrays $items, $quantities,and $prices to define **five** arrays $prod1, $prod2, $prod3, $prod4, $prod5 with individual product information from these arrays. Each array will have keys 'item', 'quantity', and 'price' to hold the respective information about that product.

3. Create an array $selected_products to hold all the product arrays $prod1, $prod2, $prod3, $prod4, $prod5 

4. Write a loop to generate the table using $selected_products as defined above. 

The final display of the invoice should be identical to Invoice4.
