  SmartPhoneProducts3 is a minor variant of the SmartPhoneProducts2 WOD replacing the variable-variables with arrays.

  Discussion:

     * 53% not DNF'ing. If you have been successful in the past but not any more be sure to reflect a bit about what used to work and what you are doing differently now that isn't working. If you did well, think about what got you there. Can you do even better? If you DNF'ed you will need to make an appointment with to see if we can figure out what is holding up your progress.
     * It's clear by the large number of Sd's that many people are still can improve their WOD performance.
     * I suggest that it's more than your programming skills needed to prepare effectively for a WOD. Consider what you need to do: (1) understand the requirements and identify where changes needed to be made, (2)determine how to convert if-statements into arrays,(3) remove code no longer used. (4) find and fix bugs, (7) use VS Code effectively. 
     *  A few people seemed a little confused about the need to use the arrays that were defined. This indicates a lack of understanding in what the if-statements were doing and how you could use an array to do the equivalent thing. So if this was your problem, be sure you understand how this works and why one way might be better than the othger.
     *  If you used $num2Day['January'] or hard coded any of the values think about why you coded to a specific problem rather the the more general problem.
     *  Many people are not taking advantage of find and replace. Too slow, too error prone to do everything manually! Learn it! Use it! Benef-it!
