  BrowserHistory7 is a minor variant of the BrowserHistory6 WOD. Here is a [sample solution]({{ site.baseurl }}/morea/040.dynamic-web-pages/BrowserHistory7b.zip) if you wish to study it.

  Discussion:

     * Many people had trouble with this WOD. There seemed to be a disconnect between this WOD and the the preparation materials. Most people said they did the WOD which should have been more than enough preparation. However is seemed that many people did not have a good grasp of using Javascript to manipulate the DOM and perhaps also not a good enough understanding of the DOM in general (like setting the value attribute of an element then reading it in javascript to use. We did not go over this much in class as there was a reading on it.  When reviewing client side processing there were no questions about the DOM or using Javascript so it was assumed that most people were "ok" with it. 
     * Also a number of people seemed confused on making a "clickable image" (i.e. hyperlink with an image). This was something covered in the HTML tutorial and in BrowserHistory4. In the future if you are unclear on a subject **please please** ask about it. Do not wait to bomb out on a WOD to let me know you didn't get something!    
     * Nearly everyone had no familiarity with select boxes. This again was in the HTML tutorial. See [http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/forms/](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/forms/).I'm guessing that most people skipped the "required" readings in HTML and CSS Resources. 
     * It is important that you have the WOD available and make sure your development system is working well **before** the WOD. If the WOD is similar to the WOD (which is usually the case), generally the best strategy is to have a  copy of the last WOD ready to go in VS Code rather that start form scratch or waste time copying it during the WOD.
     * Many students informed me that they did not do the WOD until getting under DNF. It was assumed that once they got the WOD working there was no point in doing it again. This is not the case! You are building your skill here as well as your knowledge and this takes practice, practice practice! First off, you need to make sure you actually understand what you did. For example, do you really know how to access and set attributes of DOM entities? Secondly, When I re-write a program I always discover interesting ways to make it better and develop more efficiently. Most often what I end up doing is a bit different than what I did before and I gain tremendous insight into the process. This is the point of having time limited WODs! So if you're DNFing, try re-doing the WODs until you get under DNF time. You may be surprised at how much you learn in addition to boosting your skill.
     * People generally felt that going through the WOD in the screencast was enough to learn the Javascript and DOM concepts. This is not the case! The readings are the best way to learn what you need to have a successful WOD.
     * Please don't stress out about WODs. Just do your best and keep adjusting. Where you fall short, do what you need to do to address it. Where you do well, see if you can do even better!
     * Kaz and I will do our best to help you during the WODs. Of course we can't help everyone at once and we can't spend a lot of time helping. But if you get stuck, try to figure out a specific thing to ask that would unstick you and we will try our best to help you with this during the WOD.
