  Discussion:

     * Most people said they did the WOD which should have been more than enough preparation. However it seems that many people did not have a good grasp of using basic HTML elements like `<div>` as we did not go over this much in class and relied more on the readings and tutorial. This held people up and kept them from completing the WOD. If this was you, be sure go go back to the readings and tutorials to ensure you have a firm grasp of basic HTML and CSS.
     * Quite a few people came to class with only a partially working BrowserHistory6. You cannot come to a WOD expecting to fix some exiting problem during the WOD. If you were unable to get a WOD working even after watching the screencast, you need to contact us and be sure to get it working before the WOD. It's impossible to complete a WOD if you start with something that doesn't work! Do not wait to bomb out on a WOD to let me know you had a problem with the WOD!    
     * It is important that you have the WOD available and make sure your development system is working well **before** the WOD. If the WOD is similar to the WOD (which is usually the case), generally the best strategy is to have a  copy of the last WOD ready to go in VS Code rather that start form scratch or waste time copying it during the WOD.
     * A few people have a good grasp of the concepts but got hung up by making silly mistakes that were hard to find. Once aspect programming skill is to break down what you need to do into very small increments and then build what you need using these small steps. When you try to do too much at once you end up introducing multiple errors that get exponentially harder to find and fix. So start with a small part, get it working, then extend it bit by bit until you get what you want. Learn to recognize repeated patterns. Get what you want working for just one of the things and then copy that pattern for the other similar things. For example, in this WOD you might start by replacing the onclick for the Chrome button with something that just replaces the historyDiv with an empty string (i.e. just blank it out). Then when that works, change it to get the innerHTML of the chromeDiv. Then when that works you can copy the entire onclick stuff and use it for the Firefox and IE buttons by changing just a little bit. 
     * Many students informed me that they did not do the WOD until getting under DNF. It was assumed that once they got the WOD working there was no point in doing it again. This is not the case! You are building your skill here as well as your knowledge and this takes practice, practice practice! First off, you need to make sure you actually understand what you did. For example, do you really know how to access and set attributes of DOM entities? Secondly, When I re-write a program I always discover interesting ways to make it better and develop more efficiently. Most often what I end up doing is a bit different than what I did before and I gain tremendous insight into the process. This is the point of having time limited WODs! So if you're DNFing, try re-doing the WODs until you get under DNF time. You may be surprised at how much you learn in addition to boosting your skill.
     * People generally felt that going through the WOD in the screencast was enough to learn the Javascript and DOM concepts. This is not the case! The readings are the best way to learn what you need to have a successful WOD.
     * Wade and I will do our best to help you during the WODs. Of course we can't help everyone at once and we can't spend a lot of time helping. So if you get stuck, try to figure out a specific thing to ask us that would un-stick you and we will try our best to help you with this during the WOD.
     * Please don't stress out about WODs. Just do your best and keep adjusting. Where you fall short, do what you need to do to address it. Where you do well, see if you can do even better!
