# Client Side Dynamic Web Pages
This lecture will show you how DHTML is used to process dynamic web pages (at least partially) after the page is received by the client (browser) and how client side processing can be used to create dynamic web pages and interface with the user.


The presentation slides can be found here:
[ITM352_client_side_processing.pptx](ITM352_client_side_processing.pptx)

Watch the Screencast here:

In class we will see examples, answer questions, and discuss what's on for next class.
