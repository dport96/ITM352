### Create a BLOG entry and answer the following:

1. Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)

2. Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)

3. What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?

4. What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?

 
You do not need to wait for my feedback to begin working on A4. If I see any problems with your idea I will contact you to discuss how you can address these.

Submit your BLOG entry URL here as well as the BLOG text in the submission box
