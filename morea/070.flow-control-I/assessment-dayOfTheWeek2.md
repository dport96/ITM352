  DayOfTheWeek2 was similar to the DayOfTheWeek1 WOD in terms of the conditional expressions used except conditionals were used in place of var vars.

  Discussion:

     * Over 47% completed this WOD. This is much less than last WOD. Many people did not seem prepared.
     * There continue to be some silly mistakes such as leaving out ;'s and over thinking the problem. One common problem was not commenting out or deleting the code no longer being used. Another common error was using the variable $day (the day of the month number) in step13 rather than the value computed in step12 which is the "day number". 
     * A few people did not do the WODs despite repeated reminders. Think about this, -**you have already DNFed before even  starting if you have not done the WODs.**-
     * If you are still mostly DNF'ing it's time to take a serious look at how you are preparing for class and WODs. Remember Einstein's definition of insanity - ***doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results*** Now is the time to do something different!
     * While WOD completion is not everything in this class, it is important that you build your coding skills NOW before we move into the much more difficult level 3 applications development phase of the class. So we will be contacting you if you continue to DNF on the WODs to discuss what might be done to improve before we head into the next phase of the class. 
     * If you are not DNF'ing on WODs you already have achieved level 2 skill. However while this is a "sufficient" indicator it is not a "necessary" indicator of level 2 skill. Keep working on improving your WOD performance!
