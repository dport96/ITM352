# Use conditional statements in the algorithm to determine the day of the week from a date

Start by copying the [DayOfTheWeek2](./experience-dayOfTheWeek2.html)
WOD. 

Replace the simple if-statements for **Step4 in DayOfTheWeek2** with a *switch* statement and *if-elseif* for **Step8**. 

If you have trouble with using switch you **may** use if-elseif but you will be penalized *1-min* of time!
