# Extra Credit: Take Morea survey

This semester our course website uses a technology called the Morea Framework which organizes course materials into Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments.  The developers are working on enhancements, and would like to get feedback about what you like and don't like.  

They've prepared a short, five question survey to get your feedback, and I would like to offer extra credit if you complete it. Just fill out the survey located [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J5K8hry2yjoPPNyea6T1sSC9Ec_VkFdk5-bfg9LqeOA/viewform), and provide your name and our course number where requested.   It should only take 5-10 minutes of your time. 

After the survey submission period is over, the developers will send me the list of respondents from this class, and I will award each of them extra credit.   Afterwards, your name will be deleted from the data. You can also complete it anonymously if you don't care about extra credit.

To receive extra credit, please fill out the survey by midnight, Friday, November 6. 

Thanks for your help in improving the Morea Framework.
