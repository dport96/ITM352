## Read the following tutorials:

 - [Node.js Modules](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_modules.asp)

## Browse and become familiar with the following reference material:

 - [Node.js fs Module reference](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)


**Alternatively** you may watch the [Node.js fs Module screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6dRdtOy4Bg). I really like this presentation. If you're bored with our screencasts and want some extra reinforcement I suggest watching this!   

In class we will see more examples, answer questions, and do the lab.
