  BrowserHistory4 is a variant of the BrowserHistory3 WOD. Here is a [sample solution]({{ site.baseurl }}/morea/030.ui-basics/BrowserHistory4.zip) if you wish to study it.

  Discussion:

     * Only six people finished this individual WOD successfully. However many people were close but had small alignment errors or link issues. But this being the first non-WOD it's quite common that the majority of the class will DNF or submit work with errors. Any new "exercise" program will take time to start performing well. Think about what you might do differently next WOD to improve your performance. What tripped you up or where did you perform poorly? How might you address these?
     * It is tempting to believe that something that looks "close" but has errors in it is good enough. But is it? Perhaps for a WOD there is little consequence, but for an application that is possibly going to be evolved over time this is a problem. Imagine building on a BrowserHistory4 with errors in it. You expect it to work a particular way and you build on it with this in mind. Eventually you will build on on an error and things will not work or you will have a very difficult time trying to figure out why something isn't working. You may even add more errors which just makes this worse! You program just gets junkier and harder to work with. So no, "good enough" is not good! You must continue working until you get exactly what is expected. You will find that a major part of programming is finding and fixing errors. No one finds this fun, bit it's essential. You will get very good at this by the middle of the semester and it's important that you build your skill in this now.
     * Apparently most people did not re-do the WODs until you were able to get below the DNF time. Some people said that they felt they could do it in Rx time eventually once they got the WOD done correctly first so there was no point in re-doing the WOD after getting it once. Unfortunately you are missing out on the additional practice and getting familiar with the development environment, increasing you error correction skills, etc. However the reason we time the WODs is to help you learn to be *efficient* in your development. This means figure out ways to quickly test and revise your work such as placing the VS Code window next to the Chrome window so you can instantly see the results or even more useful, make real-time adjustments such as positioning an image by changing the margins (you may have noted that if you change a CSS value in VS Code it immediately shows up in Chrome without having to hit save). Also, if you DNF on the WOD you should stop! Delete the project and start again. YES, SOUNDS STUPID but this will build your skills fast!
     * Some of you commented that you knew how to do the WOD but got slowed down with little details at the end (such as aligning the navbar icons). One thing you will learn quickly is that over 80% of the time you spend will be working on less than the last 20% of the task. So you will want to plan for this. Don't spend too much time on details at first. Get that 80% of the tasks knocked off as quickly as possible so you can focus on the inevitable 20% at the end that you know will take most of your effort. 
     * A few people had trouble with their tools or starting a a new project. Always be sure your tools are working and you know how to get started before coming to class.
     * More than one person did not do BrowserHistory3 before class thinking that it was good enough that they knew how to do it. Most of the WODs will begin with a previous WOD (often a WOD) and you will not have time to re-create it during the WOD. So if you don't do a WOD you will often have DNF'ed before even starting.
