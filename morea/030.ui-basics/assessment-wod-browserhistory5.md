  BrowserHistory5 is a variant of the BrowserHistory3 WOD and BrowserHistory4.

  Discussion:

     * No one finished this individual WOD successfully :( But this being the first non-WOD it's quite common that the majority of the class will DNF or submit work with errors. Any new "exercise" program will take time to start performing well. Think about what you might do differently next WOD to improve your performance. What tripped you up or where did you perform poorly? How might you address these?
     * It is tempting to believe that something that looks "close" but has errors in it is good enough. But is it? Perhaps for a WOD there is little consequence, but for an application that is possibly going to be evolved over time this is a problem. Imagine building on a BrowserHistory5 with errors in it. You expect it to work a particular way and you build on it with this in mind. Eventually you will build on on an error and things will not work or you will have a very difficult time trying to figure out why something isn't working. You may even add more errors which just makes this worse! You program just gets junkier and harder to work with. So no, "good enough" is not good! You must continue working until you get exactly what is expected. You will find that a major part of programming is finding and fixing errors. No one finds this fun, bit it's essential. You will get very good at this by the middle of the semester and it's important that you build your skill in this now.
     * Many of you did not re-do the WODs until you were able to get below the DNF time. Some people said that they felt they could do it in Rx time eventually once they got the WOD done correctly first so there was no point in re-doing the WOD after getting it once. Unfortunately you are missing out on the additional practice and getting familiar with the development environment, increasing you error correction skills, etc. However the reason we time the WODs is to help you learn to be *efficient* in your development. This means figure out ways to quickly test and revise your work such as placing the VS Code window next to the Chrome window so you can instantly see the results or even more useful, make real-time adjustments such as positioning an image by changing the margins (you may have noted that if you change a CSS value in VS Code it immediately shows up in Chrome without having to hit save). Also, if you DNF on the WOD you should stop! Delete the project and start again. YES, SOUNDS STUPID but this will build your skills fast!
