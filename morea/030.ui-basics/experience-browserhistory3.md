# Get ready for the BrowserHistory3 WOD: 

Prior to starting this WOD, you may want to review the Chrome Developer Tools tutorial screencasts in the Resources section of this module. Open  VS Code to your repo directory, start http-server, create a directory in `WODs` called `BrowserHistory3`

## Instructions

  1. Start your timer.
  2. Copy the index.html and style.css files from BrowserHistory2 into the BrowserHistory3 directory.
  4. Make the following changes  to the layout:

     * The introduction section should remain full-width, but the three sections on browsers should appear side-by-side as three columns, each 300px.
     * Remove the table of contents header, and instead style the list of section links in a simple horizontal bar (i.e. a “navigation bar”).

The following image shows what it should look like (click to see full size):

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to complete the WOD.
