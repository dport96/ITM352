  This assessment evaluated the ability of students to write a high quality technical essay summarizing their experiences doing a group WOD.

  Discussion:

    * Many people felt unprepared to work in a team and contribute. What can you do in the future to be better prepared to work in a team?

    * Some people thought the project was too small to work in a team. If so, what is an alternative to having everyone work on the same project
    
    * Several people complained about lack of time. Time is always a complicating factor. How can you best use the time? What helps when time is short and what hinders it?
