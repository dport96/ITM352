  Students worked in groups in-class to design a web page with smart phones for sale. The 
  amount of time given was just until the end of class (around 30 mins).

Discussion:

* None of the class finished this group WOD successfully. This being the first group WOD it's not a surprise. 
* At first people thought it would be faster and easier to work in a a group. 
But many groups found it difficult to communicate and work together 
efficiently making it actually slower!
* None of the groups asked for help during the WOD even though I went around asking if 
anyone wanted help.
* It's important to come prepared to contribute!
* Spending a small amount of time at the start planning how to work together seems to help. Diving right in
and hoping everything will come together usually does not work.
