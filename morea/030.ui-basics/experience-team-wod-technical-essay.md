# E2: Team web page development Technical Essay

By the date and time indicated on the Schedule page, after you do the group WOD,
write a technical essay (blog entry) that summarizes your experiences 
reflecting on your experience in developing basic web pages in a team.  

Do not include the source code in your essay. Instead, provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details, then discuss your experiences with each WOD.  

Use the same blog as you did in E1. When you complete your blog entry submit the link to Laulima as you did in E1. 
Each team member must submit their own essay.
