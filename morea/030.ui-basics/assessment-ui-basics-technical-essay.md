This assessment evaluated the ability of students to write a high quality technical essay summarizing their experiences doing the UI Basics WODs.

Discussion:

* Most if the essays were really good! Honest and insightful. Good job!

* I was surprised that many people commented how much they enjoyed working on the WODs and how much they got out of the experience even though they were time consuming and challenging. 

* Most everyone seems to fully understand and appreciate the purpose of the WODs. 

* It appears that if you don't repeat WODs until you get at least an Av, you still feel like you are missing something.

* Most people indicated that they worked the WODs at least 2x.
	
* Even if you had some HTML/CSS experience, the WODs were helpful and you learned something, even if it was just to be more careful and look things up more efficiently!

* Most people found BrowserHistory3 the most difficult but not BrowserHistory6. Are your skills getting better or was one WOD easier than the other?

* A large number of people did not do the HTML or CSS tutorials before trying the WOD. This led to taking considerably more time :( Time invested before in reviewing HTML and CSS might be much less than trying to learn stuff while trying to do the WOD, or worse, trying to learn what you need by doing the WOD or watching the screencast solution.

* Many people talked about how time consuming the WODs are. They can be at first, but as you can see from the screencast solutions, they do not have to be time consuming. Remember that you are still fairly *new* to this and it will take a bit more practice before you learn to be more time-efficient in your study and WODs. This is one of the major objectives of this course! Don't despair! This is just you learning :)

* Only a few people mentioned that one of the primary purposes of the BrowserHistory1,2,3 WODs is to get familiar with VS Code and XAMPP.

* Some of you published rather insufficient descriptions of your experience.  A WOD experience WOD essay should include at minimum:
  * You describe each WOD in its own section.
  * You summarize the goal of each WOD.
  * You clearly specify the number of attempts (and the Rx/Av/Sd/DNF value) for each WOD.
  * Did you look at the screencast solution first? After trying once? Never?
  * What worked well, what held you up?
  * You articulate interesting insight into the experience and insights you gained from the WODs.
