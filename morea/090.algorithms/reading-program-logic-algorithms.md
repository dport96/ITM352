Open the [screencast](https://youtu.be/qiKnL4R4m-M) and follow along with the lecture. 

**don't just sit and watch the show!**

Jot down notes with problems or questions (you can use the NetBeans editor maybe make code comments, Word, Notepad, etc.). Bring these to class.

In class we will see more examples, answer questions, and do the lab exercises.
