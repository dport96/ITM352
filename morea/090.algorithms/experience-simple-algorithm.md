# Create a simple algorithm to check your understanding.

First do the [Algorithms reading](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/algorithm.html).

Do something similar to the baking a cake example in the reading. Take a simple activity
and write out a flowchart OR use pseudo-code to describe the steps (e.g. getting dressed, d
riving to the supermarket, building a house of cards, setting the time on a clock, …). 

Pretend that these are instructions for someone who has never done whatever you’re 
describing—perhaps an alien being—so be as clear, explicit and detailed as possible.
