  This WOD asked you to modify the MakingChange2 algorithm to give the fewest coins in change given a fixed amount of each denomination. This is more realistic given that when making change you rarely have an unlimited number of each kind of coin.   
  

  Discussion:

     * Over 84.3% completion (non-DNF). 77% of these were Av and Sd **AMAZING!!!!** 
     * At this point you should be able to complete a WOD without DNFing. If you have DNF'ed on all the WODs, please make an appointment with me or a TA to go through how you prepare and get some guidance on achieving this important milestone.  There will only be a few WODs left to try! 
     * A lot of time was spend discussing the instructions before the WOD. It's great to hear that you are now asking questions before the WOD starts!
     * Some of you may feel that this WOD was easier than the previous WODs and that's why you may have been successful. An alternative explanation is that your skills have improved due to *lots of practice*. You do not have to think much about using VS Code. You know how to write a correct JAVASCRIPT statement. You are able to understand what is being asked of you and make use of hints and guidelines. Ask yourself this - would you have been able to do **this** WOD at the beginning of this semester?
     * Many people did not heed the advice about testing as you go rather than and the end. Several people committed mistakes in multiple places such as using $amount rather than $leftover and took considerable time to find and fix all of these. This could have been avoided saving a great deal of time and frustration if testing was done after each coin amount and leftover was computed!
