# Introduction to programming logic algorithms
This lecture will introduce you to the thinking process underlying programming and the fundamental idea of an algorithm. 

# Watch the screencast before class!
Open the [presentation slides](ITM352_algorithms.ppt). 

Open the [screencast](http://youtu.be/EsyKVFdbgO4) and follow along with the lecture. Be sure to try all the examples you see in the lecture  **don't just sit and watch the show!**

Jot down notes with problems or questions (you can use the editor maybe make code comments, Word, Notepad, etc.). Bring these to class.

In class we will see more examples, answer questions, and do the lab exercises. 

NOTE: the screencast uses PHP notation. The concepts are the same but the syntax for the commands are a little different.
