  This lab had you setting variables with various data types, simple operations and expressions, and manipulate strings to get desired output.

  Discussion:

    * Most people did very well with this lab. All problems completed and were correctly done. Many people did  the bonus exercise. Let's keep up this excellent work!
    
    * Many people forgot to put ;'s at the end of each statement. This is a common problem and will be difficult to find as our programs get more complicated. Get in the habit NOW of always putting a ; at the end of each statement!
    
    * A number of people used double quotes (") rather than single quotes (') when not taking advantage of what double quotes do for you. If you do not explicitly make use of double quote variable expansion or escape-characters, it is strongly recommended you use single quotes.
    
    * Many people did not answer why $stupid was stupid in exercise 3c! The point of this exercise was to demonstrate why relying on the default value of a variable is unwise.
    
    * Because this was the first lab I did not enforce the DNF times. Starting with Lab 2 we will adhere to the time allocations. The purpose of having time deadlines is to help you recognize how you need to prepare for working the labs using the pre-class readings. If you skip the readings or do not use them effectively (e.g. take notes during the screencast) then you will likely be DNFing on the lab exercises. Too many DNF's on a lab will result in no-credit. 

    * Make an appointment to come see me if you have trouble with a lab. We can run through the exercises together. This will not affect your credit for the lab.
