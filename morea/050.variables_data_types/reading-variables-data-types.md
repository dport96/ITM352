# Watch the screencast before class!



Open the [presentation slides](ITM352_data_types_variables.ppt). 

Open the [screencast](http://youtu.be/gPXZzR3_Kb4) and follow along with the lecture. Be sure to try all the examples you see in the lecture on VS Code **don't just sit and watch the show!**

### NOTE: the screencast uses MAMP which is a variant of XAMPP. You do not need to install MAMP. Everything is about the same except the name and location of htdocs

Jot down notes with problems or questions (you can use the NetBeans editor maybe make code comments, Word, Notepad, etc.). Bring these to class.

In class we will see more examples, answer questions, and do the lab exercises.
