# Use HTML form arrays to select quantities from a table of Smart Phone products and display order. Validate user input, display errors where they occur and allow for recovery.

1. Start by copying the [SmartPhoneProducts6](../120.functions/experience-SmartPhoneProducts6.html) into a new JAVASCRIPT project. Check that the table displays properly.

2. In the item selection form change the textboxâ€™s names to use HTML form arrays. That is, change the names  from quantity0, quantity1, quantity2, quantity3, quantity4 to quantity[0], quantity[1], quantity[2], quantity[3], quantity[4] corresponding to the index of the product array in $products used for that row.

3. Add validation of quantities entered into the quantity textboxes. Create a void validate_quantities() that puts error messages for invalid quantities in $_POST['quantity'] into a global $errors array.

4. Use the $errors array to display errors in the palace they occur and allow the user to fix the error and re-submit the form.


5. Make the quantity textboxes sticky (so the user does not have to re-enter all the quantities if they make a mistake).
