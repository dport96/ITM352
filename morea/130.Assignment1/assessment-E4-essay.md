  This assessment evaluated the ability of students to write a high quality technical essay summarizing their experiences and insights on their progress and the class.

  Discussion:

    * It was really good to read your BLOGs! Everyone wrote insightful responses to the questions and has many great constructive suggestions. You will find it helpful to read though your fellow studets BLOGs to see how you compare.  
    * I've makde some comments below, but more detailed comments from me [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/morea/130.Assignment1/E4_comments.ppt)
     
    1. My programming skills have greatly improved.
     * MOst people started with little to zero programming skills and believe they have now "got it" but have a way to go still. They are not totally confident, but feel ready to continue.
    2. I am enthusiastic about programming.
     * The majority of people feel somewhat enthusiastic about programming even if they were not so much so at the beginning. Assignment 1 was a struggle and it's frustrating when things don't work. Many people reported that when they got it working they were very happy and felt like they accomplished something significant. Now that you can do non-trivial things it's more fun! It's always going to be frustrating when things don't work... Stay focused on the great feeling you get when things work! You now know if you keep at it that you can and will make it happen.
    3. I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.
     * Most people cannot do the WODs without looking at the screencast at some point. Still they learn what they need to be prepared for the in-class WOD. 
     * Several people admitted they are not making effective use of the WODs and screencasts. 
     * A number of folks said that they still "reverse engineer" the screencast solution. That is, they watch the screencast first, copy the code, then try understand the WOD by studying it after (usually not attempting to do the WOD again on their own). As stated multiple times previously, you are welcome to take whatever approach you beleive works best for you. However, if you do not get the good results (i.e. DNF'ing on in-class WODs) you may consider trying something different. Repeating the same thing and expecting different results is just asking for frustratuion and dissappointment!  
    4. The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
     * Labs seem to be most helpful in ensuring you know how to apply the concepts. Just watching the lectures is not enough.
     * Time limits on the exercises are difficult for some people as they cannot always finish everything when they are still trying to understand something.
     * Many people would like to take more time working the labs but understand we have limited class time.
     * Several people indicated that they do not watch the lecture screencasts actively (or at all!) which causes them to have a hard time keeping up with the lab exercises
    5. I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).
     * Most people feel they are progressing and are ready to tackle building applications.
     * Some people still lack confidence in applying basic programming concepts (Level 2). Keep in mind that you are at another "hump" between level 2 and level 3 programming skill. You will put in a great deal of effort and it will seem you are making little progress. But you will have to trust that this will likely suddenly all come together and you will rapidly move into a new level of programmning skill. It may happen so fast that you may not even notice when this happens! Think back at bit... do you remember exactly when you were able (on your own, not following or copying) to write a line of code that did what you wanted that the computer would actually execute? 
     * Many felt that they need more time absorbing the concepts we've gone though. One note on this. You will always need to learn new or re-learn concepts. It's not possible to fully absorb everything. You just get faster and better at learning new things or re-learning things you already had experience with. 
    6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning.
     * Many exellent suggestions! I will certainly be trying out a few things.
     * Many people noted that would like to spend more time on labs. Because everyone will have troubles at different times there is no perfect speed for the labs. It will alwsays be too fast or too slow for someone at all times. One way you can help with this is to **speak up** when you are having trouble. If it's a conceptual problem, ask a question or even say "can you go over that again?" If you are having a particular problem, ask the TA for help even if it's while you are following along with a lab excercise. She comes to class to help you!
     * Possibly going over WODs in class. We have done this in the past. It's not so much that it's time-consumming. Rather, that the purpose of the WODs are to build your skill and not so much learn particular things or experience how to write a particular program. Each person have different challenges in improving their skill. This is something that needs to be done on your own and at your own pace. It cannot be imparcted to you during a class session!
     * Go over WODs or post solutions after? We actually do this sometimes, particularly if a subsequent WOD relies on a previous one. You can always ask for this! But in general, the purpose of the WODs is to assess your programming skill and identufy where you may need to adjust your approach or fill in gaps of understanding. However, you are generally expected to go over the WODs yourself if you DNFed. This helps you identify where you need top focus your efforts more. 
     * Give individual feedback on WODs that explain what's wrong with the code. This is a nice idea, but counter productive. There are so many ways to code things wrong and feebback on this is probably not helpful. What is helpful is feedback on your process (how you do something) and thinking (what you deteremine to do and why). This is best done one by going through a WOD individually with me or the TA. One note, you will get plenty of individual feedback on your assignments!
     * DNF'ing WODs is demorializing and the time pressure is too stressful. Note: It is! View this as a challenege to overcome and as a tool to assess where you need to focus your attention. By the end of the semester nearly everyone can complete a WOD in the time given. This is your tamgible measure of your progress and improvement. You do not need to stress about this hurting your grade. The WODs are designed to reward you for making progress but not penalize you if when you DNF. You are often given the opportunty to recoup credit for redoing a WOD and identfying where you had trouble and you are strongly encouraged to take advantage of these opportunties.
     * ** Go through the material (labs?) more slowly in class** I bring this up again because it is the most common suggestion/complaint. The class pace is actually set by you! You will note that I always ask you questions and to help with the lab excercise answers. This is how I set the pace. But I'm always only guessing. If it's too fast, then ask to slow down! Class time is your time and you are not expected to just follow along as best you can then catch up later at home. Make the most of your time in class! It is hard to speak up in class, but you must because the instructor can't read your mind and know that you are having trouble following!
    7. There are things that work really well my learning in this class. 
     * Lots of resources and flexability in study (for example review Powerpoint presentations rather than watch screencasts) 
     * Labs work well
     * Class is well-structured
     * Self-learning and abulity to study in different ways
     * Hands-on during class 
     * Screencasts are a chore but extremely useful, especially for WODs
     * Most people feel that WODs are stressful but really help build confidence
