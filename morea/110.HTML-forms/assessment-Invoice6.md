  Invoice6 is a variant of the SmartPhoneProducts5 WOD replacing the quantities with textboxes and a self-processing page.
  
  Discussion:
  
     * Boo! Only 8 completions. Several people came close, but the more than half DNFed :(
     * This WOD only required --5 new lines of code-- and modification of 1 line of code! 
     * This WOD was slightly different than most other WODs in that it expected you to have a solid understanding of how SmartPhoneProducts5 works and that you had a clear understanding of Lab8. Without this understanding you will have likely floundered. 
     * If you DNFed now is a good time to take a critical look at how you prepare for WODs. Do you actually understand the code you are writing or are you "going through the motions" only? Are you just copying the code from the screencast? Did you attempt the WOD before watching the screencast? Did you retry the WOD after getting it to work without the screencast?
     * All the WODs from here on will demand understanding rather than simple adjustment of code. On to Level 2 baby! The road is getting narrower...
     * --Make up opportunity!-- Do this WOD at home and get credit. First, get this WOD working. Delete it. Do it again and time yourself. Write a BLOG entry about this experience and how you can better prepare for WODs.
