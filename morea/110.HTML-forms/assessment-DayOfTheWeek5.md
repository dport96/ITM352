  Invoice6 is a variant of the SmartPhoneProducts5 WOD replacing the quantities with textboxes and a self-processing page.
  
  Discussion:
  
     * Boo! Only 46% completions. Several people came close, but the more than half DNFed :(
     * This WOD only required --1 new line of code-- and modification of 3 line of code -- and a little HTML 
     * This WOD was slightly different than most other WODs in that it expected you to have a solid understanding of how HTML form processing works and that you had a clear understanding of Lab8. Without this understanding you will have likely floundered. 
     * If you DNFed now is a good time to take a critical look at how you prepare for WODs. Do you actually understand the code you are writing or are you "going through the motions" only? Are you just copying the code from the screencast? Did you attempt the WOD before watching the screencast? Did you retry the WOD after getting it to work without the screencast?
     * All the WODs from here on will demand understanding rather than simple adjustment of code. On to Level 2 baby! The road is getting narrower...
