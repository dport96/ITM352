## Team Presentation Guidelines
Each team must create a **5-min** screencast presentation that will be used to evaluate your project. The presentation must include:

 - **Background**: what are the products or services the software deals with, what were the particular requirements and objectives established for this product and project, how were these generated and used within the project
 - **Demo**: demonstrate the use of the software using a realistic scenario, highlight features
 - **Architecture**: how does the software work, what are the main components, special designs, where did they come from,
 - **Management**: describe how the team was organized, who did what, how things got done, risks and their management, successes, lessons learned


### Grading: 
 - Each team member must present something
 - Part of your individual grade will be based on this presentation


You may organize and deliver your presentation in any way you wish. You may “team present” several sections, allocate more or less time to a particular section, etc. Be creative!!! Some ideas to consider are:

 - Class follow along demo
 - slide show
 - mock “Q&A” session
 - “Sales pitch”
 - Team demo
 - Perform a little play
