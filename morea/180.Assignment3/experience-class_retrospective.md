1.	Course Goals
ITM 352 has the following goals:
   - Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context
   - Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge
   - Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications
   - Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions
   - Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues
   - Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems
<br>
For each of the above goals, explain what stands out in your class experience that indicates you have met that goal. You do not need to be comprehensive but do be specific. You should make each goal a sub-section.
<br>
Here is an example of what you might write:  
<br>
*1.3	Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications*
<br>
Assignment 2 was where really felt I was getting hands-on experience in developing software applications. Here I felt as if the training wheels came off and I could not simply copy some code from a lab or from ChatGPT. In particular, to get the product quantities a user selected through the login and registration to the invoice helped me understand the basic software development process of first thinking though what is wanted, then deciding how to do it, and only after this writing the code to do it. Writing my comments first help organize and focus this process.*
