# About
VS Code will be the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) we will use to develop web applications. It is a sophisticated collection of development tools for:

- editing code 
- managing projects and project files
- accessing documentation
- debugging code 
- static and dynamic code analysis
- AI coding assistance
- AI Agent driven development

# Read and install
**First** Find the [appropriate setup instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for your system by selecting a link under the Cross platform section. Download and install VS Code and follow the instructions to get it setup.

**Second** Watch quick tour of [VGetting started with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics). You can skip the download, install, and launch if you successfully completed this from above.

**Third** Skim thorough the [VS Code interface overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface)

**Important** If you are not already familiar with using a command shell (AKA command shell, command line, terminal) then take a quick look at [Django Girls Command line Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/). We will be making use of VS Code's integrated terminally frequently and you need to know the basics.

## GitHub Copilot Extensions

To enhance your coding experience, we recommend installing GitHub Copilot extensions which provide AI-powered code assistance.

**Fourth** Install the GitHub Copilot extensions:

1. Open VS Code
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot" and install the following extensions:
   - **GitHub Copilot** - AI pair programmer that suggests code completions
   - **GitHub Copilot Chat** - Interactive AI assistant for coding questions and explanations

**Note:** GitHub Copilot requires a subscription or GitHub Student Pack. If you're a student, you can get free access through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

After installation, you'll need to sign in with your GitHub account to activate Copilot. The extensions will help you write code faster and learn programming concepts more effectively.

You should now be ready to use VS Code with AI assistance in class!
