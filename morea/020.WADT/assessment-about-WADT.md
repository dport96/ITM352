General comments:

- Q1: Most everyone had no trouble finding the appropriate install file. However several people just put "Visual Studio Code" as the install file name. The question asked you to indicate the filename, not what it is installing.
- Q2: Most people answered this just fine. An answer like "coding" is not incorrect but vague. Just a little more detail is needed!
- Q3: Here again several people just put "Node.js" as the install file name. The question asked you to indicate the filename, not what it is installing.
- Q4: About 40% of the answers forgot to mention anything about Javascript or how Node.js enables Javascript to be run outside a browser, which is by far its most important component! 
- Q5: Most everyone got this.
- Q6: Not problems, everyone seems to have a GitHub account
- Q6: Many people had trouble with this question. In particular, over 75% of the answers failed to mention anything about version control (or branch management)
